1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

	HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the
server sends the response to the user.  There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997
& the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

HTTP1.1
*	It works on the textual format.
*	There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
*	It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
*	It compresses data by itself.

HTTP2
*	It works on the binary protocol.
*	It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
*	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
*	It uses HPACK for data compression.


2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or 
functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string.
However, any property name that is not a valid JavaScript identifier (for example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, or that starts with a number)
 can only be accessed using the square bracket notation. This notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically determined (when the property
 name is not determined until runtime). Examples are as follows:

// four variables are created and assigned in a single go, 
// separated by commas
var myObj = new Object(),
    str = 'myString',
    rand = Math.random(),
    obj = new Object();
myObj.type              = 'Dot syntax';
myObj['date created']   = 'String with space';
myObj[str]              = 'String value';
myObj[rand]             = 'Random Number';
myObj[obj]              = 'Object';
myObj['']               = 'Even an empty string';console.log(myObj);
